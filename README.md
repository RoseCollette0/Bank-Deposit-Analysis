# Overview
Banks frequently conduct marketing campaigns to encourage customers to subscribe to term deposits. However, the effectiveness of these campaigns is influenced by multiple factors, including customer demographics, economic conditions, past interactions and campaign-specific metrics. Understanding what drives customer decisions can help banks optimize their strategies, improve engagement, and increase subscription rates.
This analysis aims to develop insights based on a banking dataset to determine the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit (y: Yes/No)
